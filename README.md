LCR-Circuit

ðŸ“˜ LCR Circuit Simulation
This project contains a simple LCR circuit designed and simulated using an electronic circuit simulator. The circuit demonstrates the behavior of an LCR network, which consists of:

Inductor (1 H): Stores energy in the form of a magnetic field.

Capacitor (40 ÂµF): Stores energy in the form of an electric field.

Resistors (20 Î© and 100 Î©): Provide resistance to control current flow and damping.

DC Voltage Source: Powers the circuit.

In this configuration:

The inductor (L) and capacitor (C) form a resonant LC circuit.

The resistors control damping and total impedance.

The switch (optional) allows you to open or close the circuit to observe transient and steady-state responses.

ðŸ’¡ Key Focus:
This LCR circuit is ideal for studying resonance, transient response, and the natural oscillations of an RLC network. It can also be used to demonstrate how energy is transferred between the inductor and capacitor and dissipated through the resistors.

Usage:
Use this simulation to experiment with different values of L, C, and R to see how the circuitâ€™s resonance frequency, damping, and time-domain behavior change.
